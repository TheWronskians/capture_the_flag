# Capture the Flag
Robot capture the flag using turtlebots. Consists of an overhead webcam which feeds a video to the master computer, which performs some colour matching to determine the locations of the robots and the ball, uses PRM to plot a path to the goal, a PID controller to turn and move to the ball, and a networking script to remotely connect to the turtlebot from the master computer.
